> Welcome to the public repository for the $ABLE token — the native utility token powering the Tradable platform and SenseAI, a decentralised AI analyst for crypto traders.
>
> $ABLE is an ERC-20 token deployed on [Base](https://base.org), bridged to [NEAR](https://near.org) as a NEP-141 token, and used as the base currency on our [Aurora Virtual Chain](https://aurora.dev). It enables verifiable, gas-abstracted AI interactions while serving as the core utility token across our ecosystem.
